    part1.cpp:  The program computes the sum of all the numbers in the txt file,
                regardless of line length or  if there are spaces/letters. The 
                -o or --output flags output the sum to a txt file named 
                output_part1 instead of the consol. The -h or --help flags 
                prints the instructions for how to run the program and about the
                flags. It then immediately exits. combos of the flags results in
                the help screen print and immediate exit. No output is printed. 
                If no output flag is specified, the program will print to consol
                the sum.
                
                To run the program use:
                ./part1 [flags] input_file_name
                
    part2.cpp:  The program takes a .txt file of 8bit binary numbers and
                converts them into their ASCII characters. Those are then stored
                into a specified file from the user's command-line prompt.
                
                To run the program use:
                ./part2 input_)file_name output_file_name
