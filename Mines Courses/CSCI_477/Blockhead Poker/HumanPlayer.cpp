// Name: HumanPlayer
//
// Description: This is a derived class of Player that
// presents domain information to the current human player
// through I/O and then allows the player to input their bet.
// Code should be implemented both to communicate to the game
// player the current status of the game (i.e. current hands
// showing, pot, bet history, etc.) and to validate the bets
// of the human player before returning the proper bet value.
// This uses the getBet() method.
