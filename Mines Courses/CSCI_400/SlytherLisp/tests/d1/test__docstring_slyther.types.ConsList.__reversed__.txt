>>> from slyther.types import *

Iterate over the elements of our list, reversed.

>>> lst = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
>>> clst = ConsList.from_iterable(lst)
>>> for x in reversed(clst):
...     print(x)
8
5
3
2
1
1

Note: Your implementation is subject to the following constraints:

:Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the list.
:Space complexity: O(n)
