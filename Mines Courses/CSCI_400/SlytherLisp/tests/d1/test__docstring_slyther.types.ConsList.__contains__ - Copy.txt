Return ``True`` if the list contains an element ``p``, ``False``
otherwise. A list is said to contain an element ``p`` iff there is any
element ``a`` in the list such that ``a == p``.

>>> lst = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
>>> clst = ConsList.from_iterable(lst)
>>> 1 in clst
True
>>> 3 in clst
True
>>> 8 in clst
True
>>> NIL in clst
False
>>> 9 in clst
False

Note: Your implementation is subject to the following constraints:

:Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the list.
:Space complexity: O(1)
