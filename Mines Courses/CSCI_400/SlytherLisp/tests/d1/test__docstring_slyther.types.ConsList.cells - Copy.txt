>>> from slyther.types import *

Iterate over eaCh cell (rather that the ``car`` of each):

>>> lst = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
>>> for cell in ConsList.from_iterable(lst).cells():
...     print(cell.car)
1
1
2
3
5
8

Note: Your implementation is subject to the following constraints:

:Time complexity: O(1) for each yield
:Space complexity: O(1)
