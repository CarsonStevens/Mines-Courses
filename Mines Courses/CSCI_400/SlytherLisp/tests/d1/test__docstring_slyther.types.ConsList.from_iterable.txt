>>> from slyther.types import *

Create an instance of ``cls`` from an iterable (anything that can go
on the right hand side of a ``for`` loop).

>>> lst = ConsList.from_iterable(iter(range(3)))
>>> [lst.car, lst.cdr.car, lst.cdr.cdr.car, lst.cdr.cdr.cdr]
[0, 1, 2, NIL]
>>> ConsList.from_iterable([])
NIL

Note: Your implementation is subject to the following constraints:

:Time complexity: O(n), where n is length of ``it``
:Space complexity: O(n) ``ConsList`` objects,
                   O(1) everything else (including stack frames!)
