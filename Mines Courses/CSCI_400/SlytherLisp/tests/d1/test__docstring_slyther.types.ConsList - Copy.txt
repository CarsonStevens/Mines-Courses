A ``ConsList`` inherits from a ``ConsCell``, but the ``cdr`` must
be a ``ConsList`` or any structure which inherits from that.

>>> cell = ConsList(1, ConsList(2, NIL))
>>> cell.car
1
>>> cell.cdr.car
2
>>> cell = ConsList(1, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: cdr must be a ConsList
