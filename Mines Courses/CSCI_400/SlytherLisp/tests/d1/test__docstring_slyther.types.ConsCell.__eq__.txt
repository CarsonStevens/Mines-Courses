Two cons cells are equal if each of their ``car`` and
``cdr`` are equal:

>>> a = ConsCell(1, 2)
>>> b = ConsCell(2, 1)
>>> c = ConsCell(1, 1)
>>> d = ConsCell(1, 2)
>>> a == a
True
>>> a == b
False
>>> b == c
False
>>> b == d
False
>>> a == d
True

Should return ``False`` if ``other`` is not an instance of a
``ConsCell``.
