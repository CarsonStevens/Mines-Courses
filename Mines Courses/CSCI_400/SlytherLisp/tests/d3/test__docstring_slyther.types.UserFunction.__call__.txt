Call the function with arguments ``args``.

Make use of ``lisp_eval``. Note that a fully working ``lisp_eval``
implementation will require this function to work properly, and this
will require a working ``lisp_eval`` to work properly, so you must
write both before you can test it.

Warning: Do not make any attempt to modify ``environ`` here. That is
not how lexical scoping works.
