There are four suits, Red, Green, Yellow and Blue, 
    each consisting of one 0 card, two 1 cards, two 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s and 9s; 
    two Draw Two cards; 
    two Skip cards; 
    and two Reverse cards. 
    In addition there are four Wild cards and four Wild Draw Four cards.
    
If the top discard is a word card then play begins as follows:

    Wild Draw Four Card - Another card is turned over on top of this by the
                          dealer.
    Wild Card - The player to the right (left) of the dealer declares the colour.
    Draw Two Card - The player to the right (left) of the dealer draws two cards
                    from the stock and loses her turn.
    Skip Card - The player to the right (left) of the dealer loses her turn.
    Reverse Card - Turn passes to the left (right), starting with the player on
                   the left (right) of the dealer

If normal play then play is as follows:
    Draw Two - When a Draw Two Card is played, the next player must draw two
               cards from the stock and forfeit her turn. Play then continues
               with the next player according to the direction of play.
    Reverse - Reverses the direction of play.
    Skip- Causes the next player to lose her turn.
    Wild cards - The cards marked "Wild" may be played on any colour or type of
                 card. The player playing a Wild card may change the colour of
                 play to any colour at all, even the colour used before the Wild
                 card was played. Apart from changing the colour, Wild cards have
                 no effect on the next player's turn. A Wild card can be played
                 under all circumstances, regardless of other cards the player
                 may hold. Furthermore, Wild cards do not have to be played
                 before a Draw Four can be played.
    Wild Draw Four cards - The playing of these cards not only gives the player
                           the right to call the colour of play, but also forces
                           her opponent to draw four cards from the stock and
                           forfeit their turn. This card can only legally be
                           played when you have no other card matching the colour
                           of the current top discard. Draw Four cards can be
                           played when the player has a matching word or number
                           card, or has a Wild card in her hand, however.
