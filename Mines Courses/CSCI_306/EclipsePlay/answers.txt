Questions:

	1. The revert button seems to undo the file to the previously saved file on local history.
	2. As you step through the function, the program prints "Who's coming to the party". 
		Then as it enters the loop and it prints:
		 	Name: (The Friend's Name)
			Email:(The Friend's Email)
		This is as I formatted the toString() function to print the corresponding information
	3. As you step through the function without the toString() function, the program prints "Who's coming to the party". 
		Then as it enters the loop and it prints:
		 	EclipsePlay.src.Friend@70dea4e
			EclipsePlay.src.Friend@5c647e05
			EclipsePlay.src.Friend@33909752
		This is because the Party Class doesn't know how to Print the Friend Object.
